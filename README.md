# solx Website

The official website for solx - a highly-efficient Solidity compiler for the EVM, powered by LLVM.

## About solx

solx is a next-generation Solidity compiler that offers:

- **Gas Optimization**: Advanced bytecode optimization techniques that reduce gas costs compared to solc generated bytecode, while maintaining identical functionality.
- **Drop-in Ready**: Full compatibility with existing solc flags and configurations. Works seamlessly with Foundry, Hardhat, and other development tools out of the box.
- **LLVM Backend**: Built on LLVM's production-grade compiler infrastructure, enabling robust optimizations and reliable code generation.

⚠️ **Note**: solx is currently in pre-alpha state and not suitable for production use yet.

## Getting Started with solx

1. Download the solx binary from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/matter-labs/solx/releases)
2. Create a solx profile in your `foundry.toml`:
   ```toml
   [profile.solx]
   solc_version = "/path/to/solx"
   ```
3. Build your project with solx:
   ```bash
   FOUNDRY_PROFILE=solx forge build
   ```

💡 **Pro tip**: You can also use the solx profile for testing and get gas reports:
```bash
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=solx forge test --gas-report
```
